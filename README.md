# ChromeAdPlugin

A simple Chrome Extension prototype that respresents a single concept.

### Current Model

Our data gets collected by large companies, sold to advertisors, and used to force (often poorly chosen) advertisements into our browser, prohibiting us form giving any feedback to the quality or type of ads.

### Future Vision

What if that space on the browser could be replaced by a colleciton of recommendations from an (AI) system that you "own." Think of it as a recommender engine that you actually want because you can control the types of products you're looking for and give instant feedback as to whether they are goood recommendations or not.
